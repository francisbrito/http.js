# http.js

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/user/http.js.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/user/http.js)

*** Yet another HTTP client for JavaScript. ***

This just a little experiment to get me on with the habits of document, testing and well, getting stuff done.

Feel free to nag-me-about/make-suggestions-on my coding style and such. I'd be pleased to listen to savvy JavaScripters like you. :)

## Installation

Install with [Bower](http://bower.io):

```
bower install --save http.js
```

The component can be used as a Common JS module, an AMD module, or a global.


## API

### http.js()

(PENDING)


## Testing

Install [Node](http://nodejs.org) (comes with npm) and Bower.

From the repo root, install the project's development dependencies:

```
npm install
bower install
```

Testing relies on the Karma test-runner. If you'd like to use Karma to
automatically watch and re-run the test file during development, it's easiest
to globally install Karma and run it from the CLI.

```
npm install -g karma
karma start
```

To run the tests in Firefox, just once, as CI would:

```
npm test
```


## Browser support

* Google Chrome (latest)
* Opera (latest)
